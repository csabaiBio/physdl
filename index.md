# Course info

In recent years we witnessed a huge development in machine learning, especially in deep learning which drives a new technological revolution. These models improve searches, apps, social media and open new doors in medicine, automation, self-driving cars, drones and almost all fields of science. In this introductory deep learning class students will learn about neural networks, objectives, optimization algorithms and different architectures. During the semester students will work on two projects, where students try out different algorithms and architectures. To successfully complete the class, prior knowledge in Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib) is required. During the course the students will learn about and will get comfortable with popular deep learning frameworks.

# Technical details:
- Neptun: deeplea17m
- Language: Hungarian (slides and the materials in English)
- Start date: 2023/02/TBD

# Grading

* 2 Kaggle competitions during the semester
* predefined points with thresholds
    * above minimal baseline: 2 point
    * above baseline: 3 points
    * being in the top 20% of solutions: 4 points 
* extra points could be awarded for a high-quality report
    * the maximal reward / report: 1 point
* ***your grade will be the sum of your points***
    * the ideal point range should in the range (4, 10]
    * grading:
        * **[5.0, 6.5): 2**
        * **[6.5, 7.5]: 3**
        * **[7.5, 8.5): 4**
        * **[8.5, 10.]: 5**
